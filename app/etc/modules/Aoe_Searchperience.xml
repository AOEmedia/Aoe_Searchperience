                    This isn't really a dependency, but we need to make sure that we get loaded after
                    Enterprise_CatalogSearch because Enterprise_CatalogSearch also is messing around with the
                    indexer introduced in Mage_CatalogSearch.
                    But as we're relying on Enterprise_Mview anyways we're already on Magento EE and Enterprise_CatalogSearch
                    should be there.
